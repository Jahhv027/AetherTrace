# 📡 AetherTrace

**AetherTrace** is a real-time geospatial intelligence feed platform that streams and visualizes live telemetry data from sensors or assets. Using **React.js**, **Mapbox**, **Kafka**, and **WebSockets**, it delivers instant tracking, mission playback, and spatial analysis features for field operations or simulation training.

Designed as a containerized, modular system with real-time streaming, AetherTrace bridges fast telemetry processing with powerful geospatial visualization.

## 📌 Features

- 🌍 **Live Map Visualization**:
  - Real-time location updates using Mapbox or Leaflet.js
  - Supports multiple asset types: UAVs, vehicles, weather sensors
  - Clustering and color-coded tracking per asset type

- 🔁 **Mission Playback**:
  - Rewind and replay telemetry streams by timestamp
  - Playback controls with adjustable speed
  - Useful for training analysis and operational debriefs

- 🛰 **Sensor Feed Ingestion**:
  - Kafka-powered event ingestion pipeline
  - Modular microservices for each feed type (e.g., GPS, temp, altitude)

- 🧠 **Offline Data Caching**:
  - MongoDB stores telemetry snapshots locally
  - Redis used for real-time buffer and speed optimization

- 🧩 **Microservices & Scaling**:
  - Containerized services for data ingestion, processing, and delivery
  - Kubernetes-ready for elastic scaling and resilience

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Mapbox GL JS, WebSockets
- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot, Kafka
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL (core data), MongoDB (telemetry), Redis (stream buffer)
- **Containers**: Docker, Kubernetes or Podman
- **Security**: JWT, HTTPS, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
